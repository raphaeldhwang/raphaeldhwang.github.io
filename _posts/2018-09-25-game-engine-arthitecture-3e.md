This is a note of *Game Engine Architecture*, 3rd Edition written by Jason Gregory.

## Part 1. Foundation
### Chapter 1. Introduction

What is game?

- 1979: toy
- Today (2018): multi-billion-dollar mainstream industry

> In this book you will learn:
> 
> - how real industrial-strength production game engines are architected;
> - how game development teams are organized and work in the real world;
> - which major subsystems and design patterns appear again and again in virtually every game engine;
> - the typical requirements for each major subsystem;
> - which subsystems are genre- or game-agnostic, and which ones are typically designed explicitly for a specific genre or game; and
> - where the engine normally ends and the game begins.
