## Newtonian Mechanics in Moving Coordinate Systems
### Rotating Coordinate Systems

In classical mechanics, Newton's laws hold in all systems **moving uniformly** relative to each other; however, in our real world, most objects are moving accelerated. For obtaining the equations of motion in a non-inertial system, we have to establish the equations in a fixed system and to transform them into the accelerated system.

### Free Fall on the Rotating Earth

Neglecting the rotation about the sun and therefore consider a coordinate system at the earth center as an inertial system.

### Foucault's Pendulum

In 1851, Foucault found a way to proove the earth rotation: A pendulum tends to maintain its plane of motion.
