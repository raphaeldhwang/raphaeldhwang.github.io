## Building Abstractions with Procedures

> **Master software engineers** have the ability to organize programs so that they can be reasonably sure that the resulting processes will perform the tasks intended. They can **visualize** the behavior of their systems in advance. They know how to structure programs so that unanticipated problems do not lead to catastrophic consequences, and when problems do arise, they can debug their programs.

### The Elements of Programming

Every powerful programming language should provide the mechanism of abstraction, that combines simple ideas to form more complex ideas.

### Example: Square Roots by Newton's Method
